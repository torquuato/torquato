                            this is my PS VITA. i got this bad boy a while ago when i was really into danganronpa. like
                            i seriously only got this thing initially to play the danganronpa games and also parapa the
                            rapper (which i didnt know at the time was only on the psp). after finding out that i
                            couldnt play parapa the rapper i kinda got bored of the thing and it would sit in my desk
                            drawer for several years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            sometime this year (somewhere around like june-july 2025) i found it again while cleaning my
                            room and went on the interwebs to see what games i could get on it. this is how i discovered
                            the psvita hombrew scene! it is INCREDIBLY easy to mod your PSVITA and you can fully just do
                            it completely in your vita with no need for a computer and such.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            here is a useful link you can use as a starting point: <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr_H4flA8Co">here.</a> im pretty sure this is the
                            exact video i watched to do my vita.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            getting into the real meat of the vita, i REALLY like silent hill origins. it was the first
                            silent hill game i properly played and imo, for the vita it was SUPER impressive and cool.
                            ive seen playthroughs of silent hill 2 and i really got that vibe walking around the town
                            and buildings which i fully wasnt expecting for the vita (especially after playing book of
                            memories). danganronpa, i loved ages ago, and i loved again when i played it on my vita.
                            SOME games crashed my vita a bunch but there is some settings in the homebrew file menu you
                            can change to minimise this im pretty sure. i think that the homebrew browser is super cool
                            and epic. there are so many brilliant game ports such as crazy cattle 3d.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            100% would reccomend getting a psvita and slapping some homebrew in that thang.
