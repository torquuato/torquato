                            this is my epic (totally) enchanted ring. i got it in lourdes of 2022 for like 50 EUR. im
                            almost certain it was a scammy price but do i care? nope. this ring has been with me for
                            several years now, it has endured many scratches and scuffs but remains strong (unbreaking
                            III) and stands as a reminder of who i was back in 2022. thinking back on days like those,
                            you just cant help but feel a bit amused/nostalgic... (mirth IV).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            also something pretty cool about this ring: i have lost it about 7-8 times now. the most
                            recent example was when i somehow lost it somewhere in the philippines when i visited in
                            2025. i misplaced it one day and bcs i left earlier than my mum, i didnt have time to go
                            look for it. i then proceeded to forget about the ring for a while until somepoint in
                            october, i get the ring back. it turns out, i left it in mindoro (boonies, a boat ride away
                            from manila) and it was accidentally taken to my grandparents house in manila when they were
                            moving some boxes back over to the main house in manila. my grandma realised it was my ring
                            - bcs obv i take it off before i shower n that so shes seen it around - and sends it back
                            home to us via ninos family who are in the philippines at this point and just so happened to
                            be going home soon. so yeah. it has some weird affinity for finding its way back to me
                            (loyalty I).
