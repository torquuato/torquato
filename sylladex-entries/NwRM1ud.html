                        <p>
                            this was one of my first casssettes in my collection! i was at a carboot sale and saw a
                            massive box filled with cassettes and vinyls. i rummaged through and found this cassette
                            between a motley crue cassette and a richard sinclair 'caravan of dreams' cassette (both of
                            which i purchased as well).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            listening to this cassette was the first time i ever really sat down and listened to this
                            album. i was sat on my own waiting for a bus on a late winter evening with my cassette
                            player and my phone was dead so i couldnt listen to spotify. so i decided to fully listen to
                            this cassette back to front and realised that it was pretty alright.

                            songs i never heard of prior that i actualy really liked? polly and territorial pissings. i
                            was surprised that there were songs that i hadnt even heard of on this album but it was
                            really nice surprise.
