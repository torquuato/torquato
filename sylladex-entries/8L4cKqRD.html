                            holy goated album. i remember first listening to my chemical romance after a long english
                            lesson in like year 10. i listened to all of bullets like 6 times in a row and was just like
                            in love. at the time i thought the black parade was a super corny album. but then i think it
                            was a very cold winters night i was sat at my computer and i just sat there and forced
                            myself to listen to the whole album. and ever since, ive loved it!
                        </p>
                        <p>ok now the story behind this cassette! i had been cassette hunting for a few months now, and
                            i REALLY wanted like ANYTHING mcr but i could genuinely find nothing! like damn i know mcr
                            is an american band but i thought i would find SOMETHING. eventually i started looking
                            online for stuff and thats when i came across a listing for the black parade on cassette. it
                            was a lot of money. more than i really had in spending money at the time. but after my
                            second paycheck i just thought fuck it and i bought the thing. a few weeks later my mum was
                            knocking on my bedroom door with a package. i opened it right there and then, she asked me
                            how much it was and i got a stern talking to about how i shouldnt impluse buy like that. i
                            SWEAR i dont normally do that but like i dont even care its a beautiful cassette.</p>
